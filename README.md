# Higgs boson prediction 
### Machine learning project

The purpose of this project is to predict the nature
of a set of collision events. The outcome is either 
a signal (Higgs boson) or a background (something else).
***
### How to use the model :

* Main files
  * __Implementations.py__ contains multiple useful functions 
  to make the predictions. More precisely, it contains everything we need for data
  processing and different machine learning algorithms.
  We implemented all 6 functions from Table 1 (project description) and an additional
  a Newton method discussed during the lectures.
  * __Run.py__ is the main script that was used to generate our predictions.
  * __Helpers.py__ regroup basic functions for .csv importation and generation.
